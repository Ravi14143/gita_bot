Translation: "King Yudhi■■hira, the son of Kunt■, blew his conchshell, the Anantavijaya, and Nakula
and Sahadeva blew the Sugho■a and Ma■ipu■paka. That great archer the King of K■■■, the great
fighter ■ikha■■i, Dh■■■adyumna, Vir■■a and the unconquerable S■tyaki, Drupada, the sons of
Draupad■, and the others, O King, such as the son of Subhadr■, greatly armed, all blew their
respective conchshells."
Prabhup■da: So here Dh■tar■■■ra is addressed as p■thiv■-pate, the lord of the world. P■thiv■.
P■thiv■ means this planet. So five thousand years ago, from the statement it appears that the king of
Hastin■pura was the emperor of the whole world, p■thiv■-pate. One king. The whole planet was being
governed by one emperor or king, and different parts of the world, other kings, subordinate kings, as
they are named here, Drupada, then Vir■■a, K■■ya, in different parts of the world they came and
joined. And each and every one of them possessed a different kind of bugle, ■a■kha. So they declared
that, "Now we are ready to fight."
And another significance of this verse is, Yudhi■■hira is also described here as r■j■. In the beginning
Sañjaya informed Dh■tar■■■ra that Duryodhana r■j■. So actually the fight is between the two kings:
one side Duryodhana, another side Yudhi■■hira. One may not misunderstand, therefore particularly
mentioned kunt■-putra: this r■j■ is Kunt■'s son, kunt■-putra. So Drupada, Mah■r■ja Drupada, the
father of Draupad■. Draupad■ was gained by Arjuna in competition. Draupad■, the daughter of
Mah■r■ja Drupada, is Draupad■. She is Draupad■. And her sons, they are draupadeya.
So the grandfather, the grandsons, all of them were present, because they were allies. Mah■r■ja
Drupada happened to be the father-in-law of the P■■■avas. Draupad■ accepted five husbands. When
Draupad■ was gained in the competition, they were incognito. The P■■■avas were incognito. They
were banished for twelve years, and after twelve years, one year they had to live incognito. Nobody
would understand where they are living. So they took shelter at the house of Mah■r■ja Vir■■a.
So Vir■■a, at that time this Mah■r■ja Vir■■a's daughter, Uttar■, was trained by Arjuna for dancing.
Arjuna was appointed as a dancing teacher for the daughter of Mah■r■ja Vir■■a, Uttar■. So when it
was discovered that Arjuna was not a dancing teacher—he was the great hero—Mah■r■ja Vir■■a
wanted to offer his daughter that, "You marry my daughter," because he was disclosed. So Arjuna said:
"How can I marry this girl? I am her teacher. Therefore a teacher is to be considered as father, so it is
not possible. So if you like, I can get this girl married with my son Saubhadra, Subhadr■'s son."
Arjuna had another wife, Subhadr■. That Subhadr■, you know, sister of K■■■a. Sister of K■■■a. So
Subhadr■; Balar■ma, elder brother; K■■■a, younger brother. K■■■a wanted to hand over Subhadr■
to Arjuna, and Balar■ma wanted to hand over Subhadr■ to Duryodhana. So K■■■a could not say
anything. The elder brother has decided. Therefore K■■■a advised Arjuna to kidnap Subhadr■. Just
see how much K■■■a was affectionate to Arjuna that Arjuna liked also to marry Subhadr■, and
Subhadr■ also liked, but the elder brother did not agree. So they made a plan that Arjuna kidnap
Subhadr■.
This kidnapping was allowed among the k■atriyas, and fight. That is k■atriya marriage. Unless there is
fight, that marriage is not complete. The red vermilion which we apply, that is k■atriya principle. After
killing the opposite party, the blood will be smeared over the hair of the bridegroom . . . er, bride. That is
conquer, victory. So in every marriage . . . K■■■a had 16,108 wives, and each wife was married by
fighting, beginning from Rukmi■■. Rukmi■■ also, the first wife of K■■■a, the first queen, when
K■■■a became king of Dv■rak■, she was the first queen. So she was kidnapped by Arjuna (K■■■a).
Rukmi■■ was settled up to be married with ■i■up■la. ■i■up■la also happened to be K■■■a's
cousin-brother, and Rukmi■■ did not like that she would be handed over to ■i■up■la. She wanted to
marry K■■■a. So she sent one letter to K■■■a that, "This is the position. My brother, Rukma, he has
decided to hand over to me to ■i■up■la, but I don't like. So please arrange for kidnapping me." A
br■hma■a was sent to K■■■a.
That is also another responsibility of k■atriya. If a girl proposes, "I want to marry you," a k■atriya
cannot refuse. He cannot refuse. He must marry that girl, even at the risk of life. This is k■atriya spirit.
One r■k■as■, she wanted to marry Bh■ma. So Bh■ma refused; she was a r■k■as■. So she
complained to Mah■r■ja Yudhi■■hira that, "I wanted to marry Bh■ma, but he has refused." And
Yudhi■■hira Mah■r■ja compelled Bh■ma, "You must marry. Even though she is r■k■as■, you are
k■atriya; you cannot refuse." This was the system, very nice system, br■hma■a, k■atriya, vai■ya,
■■dra.
(aside) Don't work now. You should hear. You cannot divert your attention.
So all these kings on the side of the P■■■avas, they were relatives, so they joined. So when they blew
their different types of conchshell, then the other side were trembled, "Oh, they have gathered so much
strength?" Because Duryodhana thought that for . . . continually for thirteen years P■■■avas were
banished, so they could not gather any good amount of soldiers. But when they saw that the so many
kings from different parts of the world have joined them, so they became frightened. That is described
in the next verse, sa gho■o dh■rtar■■■r■■■■ h■day■ni vyad■rayat (BG 1.19). They are just like
heartbroken: "What is this? They have gathered so much great, great fighters?" Nabha■ ca p■thiv■■
caiva tumulo abhyanun■dayan.
(aside) You read this verse.
Pradyumna:
(break)
sa■—that; gho■a■—vibration; dh■rtar■■■r■■■m—of the sons of Dh■tar■■■ra;
h■day■ni—hearts; vyad■rayat—shattered; nabha■—the sky; ca—also; p■thiv■m—the surface of the
earth; ca—also; eva—certainly; tumula■—uproarious; abhyanun■dayan—by resounding.
Translation: "The blowing of these different conchshells became uproarious, and thus, vibrating both in
the sky and on the earth, it shattered the hearts of the sons of Dh■tar■■■ra."
Prabhup■da: So enemy. Enemy, when one enemy fights, the other party, well-equipped, strong, so it
breaks the heart of the enemy. That happened. So there is nothing to especially . . . the breaking of the
heart by vibrating different types of conchshell from the side of the P■■■avas, it broke the heart of the
dh■rtar■■■r■■■m, Dh■tar■■■ra, his sons, one hundred sons. So from Dh■tar■■■ra,
Dh■rtar■■■ra, dh■rtar■■■r■■■■ h■day■ni vyad■rayat. And it resounded both in the sky or on the
surface. Hmm.
So I think I shall end. That's all.
Devotees: All glories to Prabhup■da. (end)
