Pradyumna: (leads chanting of verse) (Prabhup■da and devotees repeat)
(break)
Translation: "Now I am confused about my duty and have lost all composure because of weakness. In
this condition, I am asking You to tell me clearly what is best for me. Now I am Your disciple, and a soul
surrendered unto You. Please instruct me."
Prabhup■da: Hmm. This is very important verse in Bhagavad-g■t■. It is a turning point of life.
K■rpa■ya-do■a. Miserly. Do■a means fault When one does not act according to his position, that is
fault, and that is called miserly. So everyone has got his natural propensities, svabh■va. Yasya hi
svabh■vasya tasy■so duratikrama■. Svabh■va, natural propensities. It is a common example, it is
given, that yasya hi ya■ svabh■vasya tasy■so duratikrama■. One . . . habit is the second nature.
One who has, who is habituated, or one whose nature, characteristic in some way, it is very difficult to
change. The example is given: ■v■ yadi kriyate r■j■ sa■ ki■ na so uparhanam. If you make a dog a
king, does it mean that he'll not lick up shoes? Yes, dog's nature is to lick up shoes. So even if you
dress him like a king and let him sit down on a throne, still, as soon as he'll see one shoe, he'll jump
over and lick it. This is called svabh■va. K■rpa■ya-do■a.
So in the animal life it is not possible to change one's nature, which is given by the material energy,
prak■ti. Prak■te■ kriyam■■■ni (BG 3.27). K■ra■a■ gu■a-sa■go 'sya . . . k■ra■a■ gu■a-sanga■
asya sad-asad-janma-yoni■u (BG 13.22). Why? All living entities are part and parcel of God. Therefore
originally the characteristic of the living entity is as good as God. Simply it is a question of quantity.
Quality is the same. Quality is the same. Mamaiv■■■o j■va-bh■ta■ (BG 15.7).
The same example—if you take a drop of seawater, the quality, the chemical composition, is the same,
but the quantity is different. It is a drop, and the sea is vast ocean. Similarly, we are exactly of the same
quality as K■■■a. We can study. Why people say God is impersonal? If I am of the same quality, so
God is also person, how He can be imperson? If qualitatively we are one, then as I feel individually, so
why God should be refused individuality? This is another nonsense.
The impersonalist rascal, they cannot understand what is the nature of God. In the Bible also it is said:
"Man is made after God." You can study God's quality by studying your quality, or anyone's quality.
Simply the difference is the quantity's different. I have got some quality, some productive capacity. We
also produce, every individual soul is producing something. But his production cannot be compared
with the production of God. That is the difference. We are producing one flying machine. We are taking
very much pride that, "Now we have discovered the sputnik. It is going to the moon planet." But that is
not perfect. It is coming back. But God has produced so many flying planets, millions and trillions of
planets, very heavy, heavy planets.
Just like this planet is carrying so many big, big mountains, sea, but still it is flying. It is floating in the air
just like a cotton swab. This is God's power. G■m ■vi■ya (BG 15.13). In the Bhagavad-g■t■, you'll
find: aha■ dh■ray■my ojas■. Who is sustaining all these big, big planets? We are explaining "gravity."
And in the ■■stra we find that it is being carried by Sa■kar■a■a.
So the quality is the same, but the quantity is different. So because the quality's same, so we have got
all the propensities as God has, as K■■■a has. K■■■a has got loving propensities with His pleasure
potency, ■r■mat■ R■dh■r■■■. Similarly, because we are part and parcel of K■■■a, we have also
got this loving propensity. So this is svabhava. But when we come in contact with this material nature . .
. K■■■a does not come into the contact of the material nature. Therefore, K■■■a's name is Acyuta.
He never falls down. But we are prone to fall down, to be under the . . . prak■te■ kriyam■■■ni. We are
now under the influence of prak■ti.
Prak■te■ kriyam■■■ni gu■ai■ karm■■i sarva■a■ (BG 3.27). As soon as we fall down under the
clutches of this prak■ti, material nature, which means . . . prak■ti's composed of three qualities:
goodness, passion and ignorance. So we capture one of the quality. That is the cause, k■ra■a■,
gu■a-sanga (BG 13.22). Gu■a-sa■ga means associating with different quality, guna-sa■ga, asya
j■vasya, of the living entity. That is the cause. One can ask: "If the living entity is as good as God, why
one living entity has become dog and one living entity has become god, demigod, Brahm■?" Now, the
answer is k■ra■am. The reason is gu■a-sa■ga asya. Asya j■vasya gu■a-sa■ga: because he's
associating with a particular gu■a: sattva-gu■a, rajo-gu■a, tamo-gu■a.
So these things are described very vividly in Upani■ad, how gu■a-sanga acts. Just like a fire; there are
sparks. The . . . sometimes the sparks fall down from the fire. Now there are three condition of the fire
spark falling down: If the spark falls down on dry grass, then it can immediately ignite the grass, the dry
grass. If the spark falls down on ordinary grass, then it burns for some time, then again it becomes
extinguished. But if the spark falls down on the water, immediately extinguished, the fiery quality. So
those who are captured by the sattva-gu■a, sattva-gu■a, they are intelligent. They have got
knowledge. Just like br■hma■a. And those who are captured by the rajo-gu■a, they are busy in
material activities. And those who have captured tamo-gu■a, they are lazy and sleepy. That's all.
These are the symptoms.
Tamo-gu■a means they're very lazy and sleepy. Rajo-gu■a means very active, but active like monkey.
Just like monkey's very active, but they're all dangerous. As soon as the monkey . . . you'll never see
inactive. Whenever it will sit down, it will make gat-ga-gat-gat. So these are activities, foolish activities.
But when one is in goodness, he's sober. He can understand what is the value of life, how one should
live, what is the aim of life, what is the goal of life. That goal of life is to understand Brahman. Brahma
j■n■t■ti br■hma■a■. Therefore the good quality means the br■hma■a. Similarly, k■atriya.
So they are gu■a-karma-vibh■ga■a■. Gu■a. Gu■a has to be taken into account. ■r■ K■■■a
therefore said, catur v■r■ya■ may■ s■■■a■ gu■a-karma-vibh■ga■a■ (BG 4.13). We have
captured some kind of gu■a. It is very difficult. But we can immediately transcend all gu■as.
Immediately. How? By bhakti yoga process. Sa gu■■n samat■tyait■n brahma-bh■y■ya kalpate (BG
14.26). If you take the bhakti-yoga process, then you are no longer influenced by either of these three
qualities, goodness, passion and ignorance. That is also stated in the Bhagavad-g■t■: m■■ ca
avyabhic■ri■■ bhakti-yogena ya■ sevate. Anyone who is engaged in the devotional service of
K■■■a, avyabhic■ri■■, without any deviation—staunch, devout attention—such person, m■■
c■vyabhic■ri■■ yogena . . . m■■ ca avyabhic■re■a yogena bhajate m■■ sa gu■■n samat■tyait■n
(BG 14.26), immediately he becomes transcendental to all the qualities.
So devotional service is not within these material qualities. They are transcendental. Bhakti is
transcendental. Therefore, you cannot understand K■■■a, or God, without bhakti. Bhakty■ m■■
abhij■n■ti (BG 18.55). Only bhakty■ m■■ abhij■n■ti. Otherwise, it is not possible. Bhakty■ m■■
abhij■n■ti y■van yas c■smi tattvata■. Reality, in reality, if you want to understand what is God, then
you have to adopt this bhakti process, devotional service. Then you transcend. Therefore, in the
■r■mad Bh■gavatam N■rada says that tyaktv■ sva-dharma■ cara■■mbuja■ harer (SB 1.5.17). If
anyone, even by sentiment, gives such . . . gives up his occupational duty according to gu■a . . . that is
called svadharma. Svadharma means one's duty according to the quality he has acquired. That is
called svadharma. The br■hma■a, k■atriya, vai■ya, ■■dra, they are divided,
gu■a-karma-vibh■ga■a■ (BG 4.13), by gu■a and karma.
So here Arjuna says that k■rpa■ya-do■opahata■-svabh■va■ (BG 2.7). "I am k■atriya." He
understands that, "I am doing wrong. I am refusing to fight. Therefore, it is k■rpa■ya-do■a, miserly."
Miserly means I have got some means to spend, but if I don't spend, this is called miser. K■pa■at■.
So k■pa■at■. There are two classes of men: br■hma■a and ■■dra. Br■hma■a and ■■dra.
Br■hma■a means he's not miser. He has got the opportunity, great asset of this human form of body,
many millions of dollars' worth, this human . . . but he's not using it properly, simply seeing it: "How
beautiful I am." That's all. Just spend your beauty or utilize your asset, the human . . . that is
br■hma■a, to be liberal. And the . . . etad viditv■ pray■ti sa br■hma■a■ (Gargopani■ad). One who
knows . . .
Therefore Prahl■da Mah■r■ja says, durlabha■ manu■ya■ janma adhruvam arthadam (SB 7.6.1). He
was preaching amongst his class friends. He was born in a demonic family, Hira■yaka■ipu. And his
class friends, also, of the same category. So Prahl■da Mah■r■ja was advising them, "My dear
brothers, let us cultivate K■■■a consciousness." So other boys, what do they know about K■■■a
conscious . . .? Prahl■da Mah■r■ja is liberated from the very birth. So they said: "What is this K■■■a
consciousness?" They could not understand. So he was convincing them: durlabha■ manu■ya■
janma tad apy adhruvam arthadam.
This human body is durlabha■. Labdhv■ sudurlabha■ idam bahu sambhav■nte (SB 11.9.29). This
human form of body is a great concession given by the material nature. People are so miscreant and
foolish, they do not understand what is the value of this human form of life. They engage this body for
sense gratification, like cats and dogs. The ■■stra therefore says: "No. This human form of body is not
meant for spoiling like the hogs and dogs." N■ya■ deho deha-bh■j■■ n■-loke. Everyone has got a
body, material body. But n■-loke, in the human society, this body is not to be spoiled. N■ya■ deho
deha-bh■j■■ n■-loke ka■■■n k■m■n arhati vi■-bhuj■■ ye (SB 5.5.1). This human form of life,
simply working uselessly hard, day and night, for sense gratification, this is the business of the hog and
dog. They are doing also the same thing, whole day and night, working hard simply for sense
gratification.
So therefore in the human society there must be a system of division. That is called
var■■■rama-dharma. That is Vedic civilization. That is real called ■rya-sam■ja. ■rya-sam■ja does
not mean to become rascal and fool and deny the existence of God. No. That is an■rya. Just like
K■■■a rebuked Arjuna, an■rya-ju■■am: "You are talking like an■rya." One who is not K■■■a
conscious, he's an■rya. An■rya. ■rya means who is advancing in K■■■a consciousness. So really
■rya-sam■na means K■■■a conscious person. Otherwise, bogus, bogus ■rya-sam■na. Because
here from the Bhagavad-g■t■ says, K■■■a says Arjuna, rebuking, because he was refusing to fight,
because he does not know what is his duty, again Arjuna is admitting here that
k■rpa■ya-do■opahata-svabh■va■ (BG 2.7): "Yes, I am an■rya. I have become an■rya, because I
have forgotten my duty." So actually ■rya sam■ja means K■■■a conscious Society, International
Society for K■■■a . . . that is ■rya. Not bogus.
So here, Arjuna is explaining, putting himself: "Yes, k■rpa■ya-do■o. Because I am forgetting my duty,
therefore upahata-svabh■va■, I am bewildered in my natural propensities." A k■atriya should be
always active. Whenever there is a war, there is fight, they must be very much enthusiastic. A k■atriya,
if another k■atriya says: "I want to fight with you," he, oh, he cannot refuse: "Yes, come one. Fight.
Take sword." Immediately: "Come one." That is k■atriya. Now he's refusing to fight. Therefore he can
understand . . .
(aside) You can stand this side, not in front.
He's forgetting his duty, k■atriya duty. Therefore he's admitting, "Yes," k■rpa■ya-do■a,
k■rpa■ya-do■opahata-svabh■va■ (BG 2.7), "my natural duty I am forgetting. Therefore I have
become miser. Therefore my . . ."
Now, when you become miser, that is a diseased condition. Then what is your duty? Then go to a
person who can . . . just like when you become diseased, you go to a physician and ask him, "What to
do, sir? I am now suffering with this disease." This is your duty. Similarly, when we are perplexed in our
duties, or we forget our duties, it is very nice to go to the superior person and ask him what to do. So
who can be superior person than K■■■a? Therefore Arjuna says, p■cch■mi tv■m: "I am asking You.
Because it is my duty. I'm now falling in my duty, faulty. So this is not good. So I must ask somebody
who is superior to me." That is the duty.
Tad vijñ■n■rtha■ sa gurum eva abhigacchet (MU 1.2.12). This is the Vedic duty. Everyone is
perplexed. Everyone is suffering in this material world, being perplexed. But he'll not search out a bona
fide guru. No. That is k■rpa■ya-do■a. That is k■rpa■ya-do■a. Here, Arjuna is coming out of the
k■rpa■ya-do■a. How? Now he's asking K■■■a. P■cch■mi tv■m: "My dear K■■■a, You are the
most superior person. That I know. You are K■■■a. So I am perplexed. Actually, I am forgetting my
duty. Therefore I am asking You."
So you have to approach the Supreme Person, means K■■■a or His representative. All others are
rascals and fools. If you approach a person, guru, who is not representative of K■■■a, you are
approaching a rascal. How you'll be enlightened? You must approach K■■■a or His representative.
That is wanted. Tad vijñ■n■rtha■ sa gurum eva abhigacchet (MU 1.2.12). So who is guru?
Samit-p■■i■ ■rotriya■ brahma-ni■■ham. A guru is full K■■■a conscious. Brahma-ni■■ham. And
■rotriyam. ■rotriyam means who has heard, who has received knowledge by the ■rotriya■ pa■ha, by
hearing from superior authority. Eva■ parampar■-pr■ptam ima■ r■jar■ayo■ vidu■ (BG 4.2).
So here we have to learn from Arjuna that when we are perplexed, when we forget our real duty, and
therefore we are puzzled, then our duty is to approach K■■■a, as Arjuna is doing. So if you say:
"Where is K■■■a?" K■■■a is not there, but K■■■a's representative is there. You should approach
him. That is the Vedic injunction. Tad-vijñ■n■rtha■ sa gurum eva abhigacchet (MU 1.2.12). One must
approach guru. And guru means K■■■a originally. Guru . . . tene brahma h■d■ ya ■di-kavaye
muhyanti yat s■raya■ (SB 1.1.1). Janm■dyasya yata■ anvay■t itarata■ ca arthe■u abhijña■ svar■t.
You have to approach. That is guru.
So we consider . . . we take Brahm■. Because he's the first creature within this universe, he's accepted
as the guru. He imparted . . . just like we belong to the Brahma-samprad■ya. There are four
samprad■yas: Brahma-samprad■ya, ■r■-samprad■ya, Rudra-samprad■ya and
Kum■ra-samaprad■ya. They're all mah■janas. Mah■jano yena gata■ sa panth■■ (CC Madhya
17.186). We have to accept the line of action which is given by the mah■jana.
So Brahm■ is mah■jana. You'll find Brahm■'s picture with Veda in his hand. So he's the . . . he gave
the first instruction of Veda. But wherefrom he got the Vedic knowledge? Therefore Vedic knowledge is
apauru■eya. It is not man-made; it is God-made. dharma■ tu s■k■■d bhagavat-pra■■tam (SB
6.3.19). So how God, K■■■a, gave to Brahm■? Tene brahma h■d■. Brahma, brahma means the
Vedic knowledge. ■abda-brahma. Tene. He injected Vedic knowledge from h■d■. Te■■■
satata-yukt■n■■ bhajat■■ prit■-p■rvakam (BG 10.10).
When Brahm■ was created, he was perplexed: "What is my duty? Everything is dark." So he
meditated, and K■■■a gave him knowledge, that "Your duty is this. You do like this." Tene brahma
h■d■ ya ■di-kavaye. ■di-kavaye (SB 1.1.1). Brahm■ is ■di-kavaye. So actual guru is K■■■a. And
here is . . . K■■■a is advising the Bhagavad-g■t■. These rascals and fools will not accept K■■■a as
guru. They'll go to some rascal and fool and miscreants, sinful person, and accept guru. How he can be
guru? So guru is K■■■a.
Here is the example given by Arjuna. P■cch■mi tv■m. Who is that tv■m? K■■■a. "Why you are
asking Me?" dharma-samm■■ha-cet■■ (BG 2.7). "I am bewildered in my duties, dharma." dharma
means duty. dharma■ tu s■k■■d bhagavat-pra■■tam (SB 6.3.19). Samm■■ha-cet■■. "So what I
have to do?" Yac chreya■. "What is actually my duty?" ■reya■. ■reya■ and preya■. Preya■ . . . they
are two things. Preya means which I like immediately, very nice. And ■reya means ultimate goal. They
are two things. Just like a child wants to play all day. That is childish nature. That is ■reya.
And preya means he must take education so that in future his life will be settled up. That is preya . . .
■reya. So Arjuna is asking not preya. He's asking instruction from K■■■a not for the purpose of
confirming his ■reya. ■reya means immediately he was thinking that, "I shall be happy by not fighting,
not by killing my kinsmen." That, he was, like a child, he was thinking. ■reya. But when he came to his
consciousness—not actually consciousness, because he's intelligent—he's asking for preya, uh,
■reya. Yac chreya■ sy■t. "What is the, actually, my ultimate goal of life?" Yac chreya■ sy■t. Yac
chreya■ sy■t ni■cita■ (BG 2.7). Ni■citam means fixed-up, without any mistake. Ni■citam. In
Bh■gavata there is, called ni■cita■. Ni■citam means you haven't got to make research. It is already
settled up: "This is the decision." Because we, with our teeny brain, we cannot find out what is the
actual ni■cita■, fixed-up sreya. That we do not know. That you have to ask from K■■■a or His
representative. These are the things. Yac chreya sy■t ni■cita■ br■hi tan me.
So . . . "Kindly speak to me that." "So why shall I speak to you?" Here says, ■i■yas te 'ham (BG 2.7):
"Now I am accepting You as my guru. I become Your ■i■ya." ■i■ya means "Whatever you'll say, I'll
accept." That is ■i■ya. The ■i■ya word comes from ■as-dh■tu. ■as-dh■tu. ■■stra. ■astra. ■■sana.
■i■ya. These are from the same root. ■as-dh■tu. ■as-dh■tu means rule, ruling. So we can rule in
various way. We can be ruled, becoming a ■i■ya of a proper guru. That is ■as-dh■tu. Or we can be
ruled by ■astra, weapon. Just like king has got weapon. If you don't follow the king's instruction or
government instruction, then there is police force, military force. That is ■astra. And there is ■■stra
also. ■■stra means book, scripture, just like Bhagavad-g■t■. Everything is there. So we must be
ruled, either by ■astra, ■■stra or guru. Or becoming ■i■ya. Therefore it is said, ■i■yas te 'ham (BG
2.7): "I become voluntarily . . . I surrender unto You." "Now you become ■i■ya. What is the proof that
you have become My ■i■ya?" ■■dhi m■■ tv■■ prapannam: "Now I am fully surrendered."
Prapannam.
So this knowledge required, how to find out real guru and how to surrender unto Him. The guru does
not mean that I keep a guru, so, as order-supplier: "My dear guru, I am suffering from this. Can you give
me some medicine?" "Yes, yes. Take this medicine." "Yes." Not that guru. If you are suffering from
some disease, you go to a physician. It is not guru's business to give you some medicine. A guru's
business is to give you K■■■a. K■■■a sei tom■ra, k■■■a d■te p■ra (Bhajana-L■las■, Song 7). A
Vai■■ava is praying, guru: "Sir, you are devotee of K■■■a. You can give me K■■■a if you like." This
is the position of ■i■ya. Guru's business is how to give you K■■■a, not any material things. For
material things, there are so many institution. But if you want K■■■a, then guru's required.
Who is . . . who requires a guru?
Who requires a guru? Guru is not a fashion, "Oh, I have got a guru. I shall make a guru." Guru means
one who is serious. Tasm■d guru■ prapadyeta. One has to seek out a guru. Why? Jijñ■su ■reya
uttamam. One who is inquisitive of the Supreme. Not guru make a fashion, just like we keep a dog,
fashion, similarly, we keep a guru. That is not guru dharma. "Guru will act according to my decision."
Not like that. Guru means one who can give you K■■■a. That is guru. K■■■a sei tom■ra. Because
K■■■a is guru. That is stated in the Brahma-sa■hit■: vede■u durlabha■ adurlabha■ ■tma-bhaktau
(Bs. 5.33). Vede■u durlabha■. If you want to search out . . . although Vedas means knowledge, and
the ultimate knowledge is to understand K■■■a. Vedai■ ca sarvair aham eva vedyam (BG 15.15).
This is the instruction.
So if you independently wants to study Vedas, just, there is, there are some rascals . . . they say: "We
understand only Vedas." What do you understand Veda? How you'll understand Veda? So Vedas says,
tad vijñ■n■rtha■ sa gurum eva abhigacchet (MU 1.2.12). You'll understand Vedas by taking one . . .
purchasing one Vedas book, or taking it, you'll understand Vedas? The Veda is not so cheap thing.
Without becoming a br■hma■a, nobody can understand a Veda, what is Veda.
Therefore, it is restricted. Without becoming br■hma■a, nobody is allowed to study Vedas. It's all
nonsense. What you'll understand about the Vedas? Therefore Vy■sadeva, after compiling the four
Vedas, dividing the four Vedas, he made Mah■bh■rata. Because the Vedas, subject matter of Vedas,
is so difficult. Str■-■■dra-dvija-bandh■n■■ tray■ na ■ruti-gocar■■ (SB 1.4.25): for women, for
■■dras, and for the dvija bandhu. They cannot understand what is Vedas. So all these rascal
dvija-bandhus and ■■dras, they want to study Vedas. No. That is not possible.
One has to become first of all situated in the brahminical qualification, satya■ ■amo damas titiksva
■rjava■ jñ■na■ vijñ■nam ■stikya■ brahma karma sva-bh■va . . . (BG 18.42). Then touch Veda.
Otherwise, what you'll understand Vedas? Nonsense. Therefore, Vedas says, tad vijñ■n■rtha■ sa
gurum (MU 1.2.12). You must approach a guru to understand Veda. And what is that Veda? Vedai■ ca
sarvair aham eva vedyam (BG 15.15). The Vedas means . . . to study Vedas means to understand
K■■■a and surrender unto Him. This is Vedic knowledge.
Here Arjuna says that prapannam: "Now I am surrender unto You. I am now no more going to talk with
You on equal level, just as if I know so many things." He was right, but he was thinking on the material
platform. He was thinking that pradu■yanti kula-striya■ (BG 1.40). If everyone . . . this is material point.
But Vedic knowledge is spiritual, uttamam. Tasm■d guru■ prapadyeta jijñ■su ■reya uttamam (SB
11.3.21). This ■reya. Uttamam. Yac chreya sy■t ni■cita■. Fixed-up. There is . . . there is no question
of changing. That instruction is now . . . will be given by K■■■a: sarva-dharm■n parityaja m■m eka■
■ara■a■ vraja (BG 18.66). And this takes place—bah■n■■ janman■m ante jñ■nav■n m■■
prapadyate (BG 7.19).
So therefore, in order to achieve the highest goal of life, one should fully surrender to K■■■a or His
representative. Then his life is successful.
Thank you very much.
